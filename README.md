# Simulation algorithms for the 2D Thirring model

This repository contains a collection on fermion bag simulation algorithms form the 1+1D Thirring model.
It includes

* A fermion bag algorithm
* A world line fermion bag method
* An heathbath simulation of the gauged representation for comparison
* A dimer representation of the large coupling limit
